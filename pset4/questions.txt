1.  If you want your program to work universally then you cant use int and other data types
you need do use stdint.h. This gives the data type a set amount of bytes.

2.  You use these variables to make sure that variable has that certain amount of bytes.
uint16_t means that the integer has exactly 16 bytes.

3.  BYTE is 1 byte
	DWORD is 4 bytes
	LONG is 4 bytes
	WORD is 2 bytes

4. The first two bytes of any BMP file must contain ASCII B then ASCII M.

5.  bfSize is the size of the bmp file. biSize is the size of the structure.
    Both in bytes.

6.  If biHeight is negative, the image is bottom down.

7.  The biBitCount member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure determines the number of
bits that define each pixel and the maximum number of colors in the bitmap.

8.  It will return null if the file cannot be opened or it doesn't exist.

9.  The third argument to fread is always 1 because it is going throught each and every pixel.

10. int padding =  (4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4 = 3
    (4 - ((3 * 3) % 4)) % 4 = 3

11. fseek allows us to change the offset of a pointer.

12. SEEK_CUR is the current position indicator in the file.
